## notes

webpack 5 you have to install webpack cli and webpack dev server then use webpack serve, why? bc the only stable thing about webpack's API is that its unstable.

also properly set up babel/preset-typescript which has 4 config requirements. cool

source maps working kinda. anyone know how to rebase them to src?
