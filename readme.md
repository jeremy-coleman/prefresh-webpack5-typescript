## notes

webpack 5 you have to install webpack cli and webpack dev server then use webpack serve, why? bc the only stable thing about webpack's is that its unstable.

also properly set up babel/preset-typescript which has 4 config requirements. cool

git push origin main?lol

anyone know how to get source maps working properly?
